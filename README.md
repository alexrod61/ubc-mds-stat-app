# Sample Teaching Materials for the Application to [Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/assistant-professor-teaching-mdsstat)

This repository contains three sample teaching materials. They are part of my application to the position of Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT. The contents are briefly explained as follows:

- **Statistical Inference and Computation I (DSCI 552):** This MDS course covers frequentist approaches for statistical inference. It is split into two parts: simulation and theory-based methods. This [sample lecture](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-app/blob/main/DSCI-552-Lecture-Notes-and-Worksheet/08_lecture-maximum-likelihood-estimation.ipynb), and its [corresponding worksheet](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-app/blob/main/DSCI-552-Lecture-Notes-and-Worksheet/worksheet8/worksheet8.pdf), are the last ones in the course and part of the theory-based methods. The central topic is maximum likelihood estimation in a univariate framework. The sample lecture was built during the Fall 2021 term. It is based upon previous course material with extensive changes. On the other hand, the worksheet was a newly developed material during the same academic term.
- **Regression II (DSCI 562):** This MDS course covers advanced regression techniques. It is the continuation of *Regression I* (*DSCI 561*), where the program covers ordinary least-squares. This [sample lecture's topic](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-app/blob/main/DSCI-562-Lecture-Notes/lecture1_beyond_OLS.ipynb) is the introduction to regression-based cases where the ordinary least-squares method is not suitable. The sample lecture was mainly built during the Winter 2021 term, with some modifications during the current Winter 2022 term. It is based upon previous course material with extensive changes.
