# Sample Teaching Materials for the Application to [Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/assistant-professor-teaching-mdsstat)

This repository contains three sample teaching materials. They are part of my application to the position of Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT. The contents are briefly explained as follows:

- **Statistical Inference and Computation I (DSCI 552):** This MDS course covers frequentist approaches for statistical inference. It is split into two parts: simulation and theory-based methods. This [sample lecture](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-app/blob/main/DSCI-552-Lecture-Notes-and-Worksheet/08_lecture-maximum-likelihood-estimation.ipynb), and its [corresponding worksheet](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-app/tree/main/DSCI-552-Lecture-Notes-and-Worksheet/worksheet8), are the last ones in the course and part of the theory-based methods. The central topic is maximum likelihood estimation in a univariate framework.
- **Regression II (DSCI 562):** This MDS course covers advanced regression techniques. It is the continuation of *Regression I* (*DSCI 561*), where the program covers ordinary least-squares. This [sample lecture's topic](https://github.com/alexrod61/ubc-mds-stat-app/blob/main/DSCI-562-Lecture-Notes/lecture1_beyond_OLS.ipynb) is the introduction to regression-based cases where the ordinary least-squares method is not suitable.
